            How to use Git and Github for a beginner:
          </h2>

          <p>
            Suppose you have created a project and you want to make your code public, you can use Github for this.
            First you have to setup git in your system and you have to config your username and email.Also make an account 
            in Github.Once this is done, you have to click on new repository on github then name it as the name of local directory.
            Then click at create, it will generate a https and ssh key, for now you can use https link.
            Now on your terminal or command prompt, you have to first change directory to your project directory.
            Next step is to initialise git using git init, then add the files using git add *, now you have commit using git commit -m 'message' command.
            Then you have to use the command git remote add origin {the link copied from github}.Next step is to push the repository to github using 
            git push origin master.
            Now you can see your repository and all the files in it on github.

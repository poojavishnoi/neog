            We live in a society where we are surrounded by people who think they
            know about everything in the universe.We face constant judgement from
            this broken society.Never focus on what the world has to say about you.
            Rather turn your focus inside and listen what your inner voice has to 
            say to you.We hold great amout of basic.There is a saying that goes 
            -Criticisms of a society filled with fools have no power in them to 
            bother the sage that has emerged from the agonizing fire of misery.
          </p>
          <h2>All we need is Perception</h2>
          <p>
            Our personal experiences and mental reasoning skills establish the range of our perception of reality. Our physical and mental abilities determine the outer perimeter regarding what we can experience and learn. Our inaugurating dreams are unlimited by physical reality and our genetic composition. There will always be an unbridgeable rift between countless combinations of human dreams and the infinity of reality, unless we accept what we are without wishing to be something else. Dummy text is also used to demonstrate the appearance of different
            typefaces and layouts, and in general the content of dummy text is
            nonsensical. Due to its widespread use as filler text for layouts,
            non-readability is of great importance: human perception is tuned to
            recognize certain patterns and repetitions in texts. If the distribution
            of letters and 'words' is random, the reader will not be distracted from
            making a neutral judgement on the visual impact and readability of the
            typefaces (typography), or the distribution of text on the page (layout
            or type area). For this reason, dummy text usually consists of a more or
            less random series of words or syllables. This prevents repetitive
            patterns from impairing the overall visual impression and facilitates
            the comparison of different typefaces. Furthermore, it is advantageous
            when the dummy text is relatively realistic so that the layout
            impression of the final publication is not compromised.

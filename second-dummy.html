            First I'll go with something that happended with my friend which made me think this way.So
            she bought pair of scanted candles for some festival, She decided to use it on that special day.
            So she kept those candles with other artifacts.Finally the day came, but she was so busy that she
            forgot about those candles.After that on one fine day, she was cleaning the artifacts, She saw the candles 
            which was now a blob of wax.When 
          </p>

            Just do what makes you happy now, nobody guarantees tomorrow.

          <p>
            Rather than waiting for a Special day, why can't we celebrate our each day as special day. By doing little
            things for ourselves and for other, we can make our day special. The most basic thing we can do is that, we
            can help our mother, when we meet someone, the first thing we can do is smile. A small smile can brighten 
            someone's day.Admiring small things around us can also make our day nice.

            <p style="background-color: rgb(192, 191, 191); padding: 1rem; border-radius: 5px;">For me, I feel my day is special and happy, when i do something that i love to do, call it cooking or taking a walk
                or feeding animals.

            In this lockdown period, I have 
            seen my friends binge watching series, movies, animes, etc. I mean it's okay for some amount of time but 
            people sit in front of their screens all day long feeling unproductive at the end of the day. By giving 
            these kind of stuff a particular time and using the remaining time for doing something that can be valuable to 
            our mental health , that can actually brings peace to us can also make our day nice.

            We live in abundance, but suffer from a scarcity mindset. why we, as humans, stockpile stuff, the mindsets 
            that drive this action, and why it is imperative that we change before it's too late.Believe in the little 
            things tha turn out to be big in the end. Focus on little things.Go and wear that dress that you saved for 
            tHe BIG day.

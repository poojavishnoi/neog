            First I'll go with something that happended with my friend which made me think this way.So
            she bought pair of scanted candles for some festival, She decided to use it on that special day.
            So she kept those candles with other artifacts.Finally the day came, but she was so busy that she
            forgot about those candles.After that on one fine day, she was cleaning the artifacts, She saw the candles 
            which was now a blob of wax. 
          </p>

            Just do what makes you happy now,nobody guarantees tomorrow.
          </h2>

          <p>
            We live in abundance, but suffer from a scarcity mindset. why we, as humans, stockpile stuff, the mindsets 
            that drive this action, and why it is imperative that we change before it's too late.Believe in the little 
            things tha turn out to be big in the end. Focus on little things.Go and wear that dress that you saved for 
            tHe BIG day.
